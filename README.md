# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning repository! This collection features hands-on projects focused on solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. Lending Club Loan Default Prediction
This project uses a subset of LendingClub loan data to build a classification model that predicts whether a borrower will repay their loan. It involves extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning classifiers.

- **Goal:** Predict loan repayment status based on borrower and loan attributes.
- **Dataset Source:** [LendingClub on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

### 2. King County House Price Prediction
This regression-based project aims to predict housing prices in King County, WA, using a dataset that includes features like number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. The model is developed using deep learning (Keras).

- **Goal:** Predict housing prices from feature data.
- **Dataset Source:** [House Sales on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
